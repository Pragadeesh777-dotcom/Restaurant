                    <p>Chicken curry is a flavorful dish featuring tender chicken pieces cooked in a spiced sauce made with onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili. Variations add creamy coconut milk, yogurt,
                        tomatoes, or cream for extra richness. It pairs perfectly with rice or flatbread.</p>

                    <p>French fries are batonnet or julienne-cut potatoes, deep-fried to a fluffy inside and crispy outside. Traditionally prepared via a two-stage frying process—first at low heat to cook through, then at high heat for golden crispness.
                        They’re served hot, salted, and accompanied by ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar as a side dish.</p><br>
